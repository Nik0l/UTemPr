<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to UtemPro.</h3>

<p>This website describes the framework <a href="https://github.com/Nik0l/UTemPro">"UtemPro"</a> for predicting human behavior on the web. The framework uses Machine Learning techniques to predict various types of human behavior. It is open-source, simple, light-weight and extendable.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it for?</h3>

<p>Many companies and individuals have accumulated large amounts of digital data on human behavior but struggling to use it for their benifits. For example, online sellers store the information on users, transaction history, manufactorers, prices. This data can be used for improving customer support, increasing sales and optimizing business processes. Predicting when a user will respond to an email or a question on a forum, or how many users will join an online community - this is a short list of typical predictions solvable by this framework.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Utempro?</h3>

<p>It is not a secret that there are many data analysis libraries, frameworks, and tools. However, UtemPro has several unique qualities which distinguish it from the others. First, UtemPro automatically extracts features for prediction of human activity. The features can be easily analyzed since they are saved as a csv file. Second, these features are merged into a .csv file for using them for building a predictive model. Last, different machine learning algorithms are tried automatically in order to achieve a fast and accurate prediction. Actually it is the goal of our framework - to provide fast and accurate predictions, as simple as possible.</p>

<p>UtemPro allows to visualize the results of a prediction so a user can decide for himself which optimal configuration of features and machine learning algorithms to use. We implemented several visualizations with a recommendation system based on previous user experience. </p>
