A framework for prediction of human behavior on the Web. 

The framework is written mostly in Python 2.7.

Dependencies:
scikit-learn, nolearn, NLTK, matplotlib, sqlite3, GeoPy, pyenchant, igraph


We give an example of predicting human behavior in the context of social networks and media. For example, the framework allows to predict when a user will get involved in an interaction or make an action.

### For your business:

The framework provides an API and has been tested on Stack Exchange forums, Twitter, and Facebook. For example, we predicted when a user answers a question on a Q&A forum, rather a user reply or retweet a message on Twitter, who most probably 'likes' your post on Facebook. 

### For data scientists:

The framework allows to explore communication on social networks, analyze the data, choose a prediction task, choose features for prediction, machine learning (ML) algorithm. Then a user can explore the results of the prediction, its accuracy and time performance.
