A framework for prediction of human behavior on the Web. 

The framework is written mostly in Python 2.7.

Dependencies:
scikit-learn, nolearn, NLTK, matplotlib, sqlite3, GeoPy, pyenchant


We give an example of predicting human behavior in the context of Q&A forums. We predict when a user answers a question.

[In progress] The framework provides an API and has been tested on Stack Exchange websites. The framework allows a user to choose a Q&A community/forum (currently 'only' 148 Stack Exchange websites) and then explore it, analyze, choose a prediction task, choose features for prediction, machine learning (ML) algorithm. Then a user can explore the results of the prediction, its accuracy and time performance.
